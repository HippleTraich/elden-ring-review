            I should probably preface this whole thing by declaring myself a Soulsbourne noob.
            <br>
            <br>
            My only experience with a From Software game prior to Elden Ring was a brief encounter with Dark Souls. I had heard talk of its difficulty and assumed I was up to the challenge. I was not, or so I thought.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Dark Souls journey  started rather well for me since I beat the Asylum Demon quite handily. However, from there, I was taken to another location. This is where it turned sour.
            <br>
            <br>
            I went left and down a set of stairs. Following the path around until I arrived at a graveyard. This area was populated with sword wielding skeletons. I attempted to combat these skeletons but could not defeat them as whenever I'd knocked one to the ground and broke the skeleton apart, they would reform and once again rise to their feet.
            <br>
            <br>
            I tried this several times and died repeatedly.
            <br>
            <br>
            My next plan of action was to run past the skeletons instead of engaging them. I ran into a giant skeleton.
            <br>
            <br>
            After several hours of failing to get out of this area, I gave up. Clearly, the confidence I had in overcoming the perceived difficulty of this game was unfounded. I then believed I was not up to the task.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fast forward a few years and I saw a video on YouTube from WhatCulture Gaming titled '10 Mistakes All Gamers Made.'
            <br>
            <br>
            This list contained an entry for Dark Souls and the mistake was described as 'heading left and going to the graveyard first.' They explained that the graveyard is a later game area as you can obtain weapons and equipment that'll keep the skeletons down for good rather than having them reform. Apparently, there were two more options available to me regarding a direction to travel in, I did not notice these as the time but with this information, I vowed to one day go back to Dark Souls to challenge myself once again. The game remains installed on my Xbox hard drive to this day.
            <br>
            <br>
            A short while after watching that WhatCulture video, I heard that Elden Ring was in development.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was stated that George RR Martin would be heavily involved in the project and as a huge Game of Thrones fan (except the last two seasons, but that's another story for another day) I was drawn in immediately.
            <br>
            <br>
            I closely followed the development of Elden Ring, regularly watching YouTube videos and reading articles pertaining its progress.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before I knew it, February 25th, 2022, rolled around and it was time to venture into the Lands Between.
            <br>
            <br>
            Would I manage to overcome the challenging difficulty of this game, or would I falter at the first hurdle like I did with Dark Souls?
